# Welcome to the FreeCasino project!
This is planned to be a free and open source cross-platform Java casino program. I am still working on the basic structure, but the following games are planned for its initial release:
1. Baccarat
2. Big Six
3. Blackjack (the American version with a dealer hole card)
4. Craps
5. Keno
6. Poker (many popular variations of both ring and video poker)
7. Red Dog
8. Roulette (both the American double-zero game and the European single-zero game; the triple-zero game might be considered in the future as well)

I am open to adding more games over time (sic bo, British and Australian pontoon, more poker games, etc.) but I think this is a good set of games to start with.

Feel free to chip in if you'd like to help! Please read the [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you begin. I also have two similar projects for different categories of games, [FreeCardAndBoard](https://github.com/StrangerCoug/FreeCardAndBoard) and [FreeSolitaire](https://github.com/StrangerCoug/FreeSolitaire); this project often shares code with the other two.

This is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project; therefore, you will need Maven to build the program.
